<h1>SOLID</h1>

<ul>

<li>Single Responsability Principle</li>
<p>One class or method must have a only reason for to change.</p>

<li>Open Closed Principle</li>
<p>Objects or entities should be open for extension but closed for modification. That means that when we need add new funcionalities we must extend and don't change original source code.</p>


<li>Liskov Substitution Principle</li>
<p>One derived class must be replaceable by its base class</p>

<li>Interface Segregation Principle</li>
<p>One class must not to be force to implement interface and methods that they will not used.</p>

<li>Dependency Inversion Principle</li>
<p>Depend of abstractions, not implementations</p>

</ul>
